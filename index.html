                <h1>My Love Letter to You</h1>
                <p>Dear Emad,</p>
                <p>
                   

Happy one-year anniversary! 🥳 I can’t believe it’s been a whole year since we started this amazing journey together. I just wanna say how much you mean to me. You saved me, like for real, and I don’t know where I’d be without you.

You’ve always been there for me, cheering me on when I felt like giving up. Your motivation means everything. I remember those tough days when I thought I couldn’t make it, but you were right there, pushing me to keep going. You believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself, and I’m so grateful for that.

I also think about all the fights we’ve had, especially that one time we argued about. I know I’ve made some big blunders, and I feel so guilty for the times I hurt you. You’ve been so kind to stay by my side and forgive me when I didn’t deserve it. Your patience and understanding mean the world to me, and I promise to do better.

Even when things get rough, you make me feel secure and super happy. I know we’ll have many more fights in the future, but that’s okay. We always find a way to be happy again, right? I found you when I was at my lowest and although it started out as lets not get too serious but who knew I would get that seriod I have no regrets and doubts about being with you.
I know you are going to be a great father and a great husband. You deserve so much in this entire world Emad.You are my sunshine you bring peace into my life and you have taught me things that not even my parents or friends could ever teach me. I know we have had our ups and downs and sorry  I am an anxious little bitch but thank you for loving me
 Thank you so much and hope you liked my presents.I can totally see us having kids together someday, and just thinking about it makes me smile.

Your absence sometimes hits hard, but you’ve changed my life in the best way possible. I’m so grateful for everything you do and for the love we share. You really are my rock, and I can’t wait for all the adventures we’ll have together.

Thanks for being you and for loving me the way you do, even when I mess up. I love you so much, and here’s to many more amazing years together! ❤️

Forever yours,
Tooba

                <p>Love, Tooba 💕</p>
